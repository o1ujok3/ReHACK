# ReHack Recruitment

## Project Description

This job recruitment agency is dedicated to helping individuals find their desired job based on their unique criteria. Individuals will have to highlight their job title, the location in which the job is situated and their desired salary. By partnering with this agency, job seekers gain access to a broad range of job opportunities and find the perfect job that meets their criteria. It was created using `react` framework and `node.js` library, two third-party APIs, `bootstrap` and `font-awesome` packages. The app was deployed using Netlify. 

There is a contact session in the website for the user to contact the ReHack Recruitment Agency directly.
